Usage:
	java -jar jccal.jar [params]

Parameters:
	-help - print this help message and exit.
	
	-fm - flip layout for months (columns: weeks, rows: days of week).
	-fy - flip layout for year (months top to bottom instead of left to right).
	-cols <val> - number of columns to render months in.
	
	-hlonly - render only highlights (current day, day of week, week number).
	-hldate <yyyy-mm-dd> - instead of highlighting today's date, highlight some other specific date.
	-hly <val> - move highlight date year: pX - add X, mX - subtract X (m2 - for 2 years before, p3 - for 3 years after etc). 
	-hlm <val> - move highlight date month: pX - add X, mX - subtract X (m2 - for 2 months before, p3 - for 3 months after etc). 
	-hld <val> - move highlight date day: pX - add X, mX - subtract X (m2 - for 2 days before, p3 - for 3 days after etc). 
	
	-sy <val> - start year - absolute (2012 etc) or relative (m3 - for 3 before, p2 - for 2 after etc).
	-ey <val> - end year - absolute or relative.
	-sm <val> - start month - absolute (12 etc) or relative (m2 - for 2 before, p3 - for 3 after etc).
	-em <val> - end month - absolute or relative.
	
	-phx <val> - horizontal axis values position: f, l or n - first (left/top), last (right/bottom) or none.
	-pvx <val> - vertical axis values position: f, l or n - first (left/top), last (right/bottom) or none.
	-ptl <val> - month title line position: f, l, n - top, bottom, none.
	-tlny - do not render year near month title.

	-wdn <val> - week days names capitalization change: u - uppercase, l - lowercase.
	-lzd - add leading zeroes to dates (i.e. render |08|09|10| instead of |8 |9 |10|).
	-lzw - add leading zeroes to week numbers.
	
	-mhs <val> - horizontal separator inbetween months: any string. No newline for empty string - use single space to just add newline. 
	All newlines inside separator will be moved to the end of the line (i.e. pass in one line separator to have double line separation). 
	-dhs <val> - horizontal separator inbetween days: any string. No newline for empty string - use single space to just add newline.
	All newlines inside separator will be moved to the end of the line (i.e. pass in one line separator to have double line separation).
	-mvs <val> - vertical separator inbetween months: any string.
	-dvs <val> - vertical separator inbetween days: any string.
	-nosep - render separators as spaces, keeping positions/spacing the same (horizontally and vertically).

Notes/Known issues:
	* Currently minus symbol (the "-") cannot be used within parameters values as parser recognizes it for start of next parameter.
	* There is no way to change starting day of week at the moment - for now weeks always start on Monday. Also first week of the year
	is computed using ISO rule, i.e. first week of the year to have 4 days (or equally, first week to include Thursday this year).
